# Live Run Preflight Check Workflow

## Goal

Validate live-run prerequisites before execution so evidence can be captured and
results are trustworthy.

## Execution Flow

1. Validate required artifacts exist for selected scenario.
2. Validate observability is enabled for required telemetry surfaces.
3. Validate traceability IDs are present/resolvable.
4. Validate environment and configuration match intended run target.
5. Confirm evidence capture paths for outputs and intermediate artifacts.
6. Produce pass/fail readiness decision with minimal unblock actions.

## Decision Gates

1. Artifact gate:
   - fail preflight if required artifacts are missing.
2. Observability gate:
   - fail preflight if required logs/traces/metrics cannot be captured.
3. Traceability gate:
   - fail preflight if run evidence cannot be linked to scope.
4. Environment gate:
   - fail preflight if environment is invalid for scenario intent.

## Exit Criteria

- Preflight pass with ready evidence paths, or
- Preflight fail with explicit minimal prerequisites to unblock.
