# Live Run Closeout Workflow

## Goal

Finalize live-run resolution with durable evidence and route learnings into
tests, specs, and future scenarios.

## Execution Flow

1. Record root cause and failure boundary summary.
2. Record applied bounded fix and scope.
3. Record validation evidence proving resolution.
4. Identify follow-up updates for:
   - tests
   - specs
   - scenario catalog
5. Decide:
   - closeout ready -> pass to thread closeout readiness prompt
   - closeout blocked -> return to scenario planning for explicit follow-ups

## Decision Gates

1. Evidence gate:
   - no closeout without root cause/fix/validation evidence bundle.
2. Learning gate:
   - at least one explicit backfeed decision is required
     (tests/specs/scenarios: update now, defer with reason, or no-change with reason).
3. Traceability gate:
   - closeout fails if linkage is missing.

## Exit Criteria

- Closeout bundle is complete and actionable for lifecycle closure, or
- Blockers are explicitly recorded with next correction path.
