# Roadmap To Closeout Workflow

## Purpose

Run a deterministic closure path from active roadmap/workstream/thread state to safe roadmap closeout.

## Entry Criteria

- roadmap/workstream/thread lineage is identified
- current statuses and known blockers are available
- relevant specs/plans/checkpoint evidence are discoverable

## Steps (Ordered)

1. Run thread closure review with [thread-closeout-readiness-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/thread-closeout-readiness-prompt.md)
2. Resolve thread blockers using [implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md)
3. Run workstream closure review with [workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md)
4. Resolve workstream blockers using [implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md)
5. Run roadmap closure review with [roadmap-closeout-readiness-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/roadmap-closeout-readiness-prompt.md)
6. If closure-ready, run final verification and close

## Decision Gates

- thread gate: close as `completed` or `dropped` only when closure requirements pass
- workstream gate: close only when all child threads are terminal and evidence-complete
- roadmap gate: close only when lifecycle, structure, and deliverable checks pass

## Exit Criteria

- roadmap closure decision returned (`close now` or explicit blocker path)
- if `close now`, validations pass and status update is justified

- [implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md](../prompt_templates/implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md)

## Related Skills

- `executing-plans`: execute bounded actions between closeout gates
- `verification-before-completion`: required before closure/pass claims
- `planning-dispatch`: reroute when blockers require upstream artifact changes

## Failure/Recovery Path

- if closeout gate fails, classify blocker (`execution|evidence|status-hygiene|scope-decision`)
- select one bounded next action via next-action gate prompt
- re-run the failed gate only after blocker completion
