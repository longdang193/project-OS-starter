# Test Failure Triage Workflow

## Purpose

Resolve failing tests systematically with minimal, spec-aligned fixes and no
unnecessary scope growth.

## Execution Flow

1. Reproduce the failing test(s).
2. Isolate failure boundary:
   - test-level
   - module-level
   - integration-level
3. Classify the failure:
   - regression
   - flaky
   - environment/config issue
   - spec mismatch
   - missing implementation
4. Define minimal required fix.
5. Apply fix.
6. Rerun targeted tests first.
7. Rerun full suite if needed by impact/risk.
8. Confirm stability and no unintended regressions.

## Decision Gates

1. Classification-before-fix gate:
   - do not implement until failure class is explicit.
2. Minimal-fix gate:
   - reject broad refactors unless explicitly required to fix boundary.
3. Spec-alignment gate:
   - reject “make tests green only” fixes that violate intended behavior/spec.
4. Stability gate:
   - pass requires targeted rerun success; full rerun required when risk warrants.

## Anti-Patterns To Avoid

- overfitting logic only to satisfy one test path
- changing expected behavior without spec/intended-behavior justification
- expanding scope beyond minimal fix boundary

## Failure/Recovery Path

- if targeted rerun fails, reassess boundary/classification before adding new code
- if failure is flaky, treat stabilization as first-class task with evidence
- if environment/config issue, fix runtime/config root cause before code patching
- choose one next bounded action via `implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md`

## Exit Criteria

- failing tests are reproduced and classified
- minimal fix is applied and justified
- targeted rerun passes
- full suite rerun passes when required
- no unintended regressions observed
