# Repo Governance

This document defines how a private project repo is organized for humans and agents.

## Repo Roles

- Private repo:
  - full development source of truth
  - internal docs, workflows, specs, plans, and tooling are allowed
- Public repo:
  - curated product-facing mirror
  - receives only intentionally published code and docs

Normal development happens only in the private repo.

## Structure Model

The repo uses five distinct internal layers:

1. `docs/operating_system/`
- human-readable repo rules and workflows
- publication policy
- doc-system and planning rules
- internal tooling pilots
- agent memory under `docs/operating_system/agent_memory/`

2. `agent-core/`
- shared agent-facing source material
- small principles
- structured policy intent
- adapter source files

3. `.agents/skills/`
- repo-local Codex skill discovery surface
- focused task playbooks

4. adapter outputs
- `AGENTS.md`
- nested `AGENTS.md`
- `codex/rules/*.rules`
- sync and verification scripts under `scripts/`

## Ownership Rules

### `docs/operating_system/`

Owns:

- repo operating rules
- workflow governance
- publication workflow
- tool adoption policy
- operational agent memory

Does not own:

- product behavior
- runtime code contracts
- task playbooks

`docs/operating_system/agent_memory/` stores compact operational memory for agents. It does not replace feature docs, specs, plans, or generated rules.

### `agent-core/`

Owns:

- shared agent-facing material that may be rendered into adapter-specific files

Does not own:

- the full human governance layer
- public product docs

### `.agents/skills/`

Owns:

- reusable execution workflows
- the canonical Codex skill discovery surface in phase 2

Does not own:

- publication policy
- repo-wide governance
- adapter syntax

Formal shape is governed by `docs/operating_system/skills-governance.md`.

## Private / Public Boundary

The following are private-only by default:

- `docs/operating_system/`
- `agent-core/`
- `codex/rules/`
- root and nested `AGENTS.md`
- `.agents/`
- `.cursor/`
- `docs/superpowers/`
- `logs/`
- `sample/`

The public repo must not depend on these files to understand or use the product.

## Current Phase

Phase 2 keeps `.agents/skills/` as the canonical skill source.

This avoids breaking current Codex skill discovery while the new `agent-core/` and adapter sync layer stabilizes.

Longer term, `agent-core/skills/` may become canonical, with `.agents/skills/` generated or synchronized from it.

## Adapter Workflow

When changing:

- `agent-core/adapters/*`
- `agent-core/policies/*`
- generated `AGENTS.md`
- generated `codex/rules/*.rules`

run:

```powershell
.\scripts\sync_agent_adapters.ps1
.\scripts\verify_agent_adapters.ps1
```

## Hook Workflow

The repo hook workflow is part of normal enforcement.

CI is expected to run adapter verification, baseline checks, and publication-boundary validation on push and pull request events so drift and broken changes are caught before merge.

When hooks expose repeated or important failures:

- summarize the reusable lesson in `docs/operating_system/agent_memory/`
- then promote important recurring failures into stronger guardrails when appropriate:
  - a repo rule
  - a script check
  - a test
  - or an explicit follow-up plan
