## Generated adapter headers drift across worktrees

- Title: Generated adapter headers must use repo-relative source paths
- Date: 2026-04-09
- Trigger / Context: Adapter verification ran in a different machine path or git worktree.
- What went wrong: Generated `AGENTS.md` or rule files embedded absolute local paths, so sync and verify drifted across worktrees and CI.
- Correct behavior: Generated headers should use repo-relative source paths so outputs stay stable across machines and worktrees.
- Prevention added or required: Keep repo-relative path handling in the adapter sync and verify scripts.

## Publication dry runs should not require a public remote

- Title: Dry-run publication should not depend on push-only remote state
- Date: 2026-04-09
- Trigger / Context: Publication-boundary validation ran in CI or a local repo without a configured public remote.
- What went wrong: The publication script resolved the public remote even when `-Push` was not requested, causing dry runs to fail for the wrong reason.
- Correct behavior: Dry-run publication should validate the export boundary without requiring the public remote; remote resolution is only required for `-Push`.
- Prevention added or required: Keep the public-remote lookup behind the `-Push` path.
