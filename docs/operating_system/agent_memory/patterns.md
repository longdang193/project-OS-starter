# Patterns

## Adapter source changes

- Change adapter sources in `agent-core/`, not generated `AGENTS.md` or `codex/rules/*.rules`.
- After adapter-source edits, run sync and verify before calling the work complete.

## Cross-cutting repo work

- If the work changes repo operating behavior rather than a product feature contract, keep docs under `docs/operating_system/` and use `Feature: none`.
- Update only the smallest set of governance docs needed to explain the new operating behavior.

## Keep code-like templates neutral unless validators explicitly ignore them

- Architecture template snippets under docs can be mistaken for live source metadata when they use real code extensions such as `.py`.
- Prefer neutral filenames such as `.py.template` for copyable examples, or add a narrow validator ignore rule with tests.
- Do not weaken live metadata validation just to make examples pass.

## Spec to plan to execution

- Write the spec first for new cross-cutting repo behavior.
- Turn the approved direction into a concrete implementation plan.
- Execute the plan with verification evidence before claiming completion.

## Feature-local architecture lineage

- Edit `docs/features/<feature_id>/feature.source.yaml` for feature meaning, not generated `<feature_id>.yaml` files.
- Edit `docs/stages/<stage_id>.source.yaml` for stage meaning, not generated stage contracts.
- Treat capabilities as downstream of features: managed capability IDs should be feature-qualified as `<feature_id>.<capability_slug>`.
- Use Python `@meta` for file ownership, `@capability` only for canonical capability-owning functions, and `@proves` for test proof evidence.
- Regenerate `lineage.generated.yaml`, generated feature contracts, and `docs/generated/*` after feature/source/spec/plan/code/test/doc metadata changes.
- `history.md` is partially generated: keep human notes below the generated block and do not hand-edit the generated history markers.

## Smoke profiles are for wiring confidence, not model ranking

- Treat smoke data and smoke HPO profiles as orchestration and artifact checks first.
- Do not treat smoke metrics as decision-grade evidence for model-family selection.
- When a smoke HPO winner is exported into a fixed train config, the success criterion is handoff consistency, not business-quality ranking confidence.

## Release lineage comes from source manifests

- Treat CLI config paths in release commands as operator declarations, not proof of training lineage.
- Before model registration or deployment, validate release declarations against source job manifests such as `train_manifest/step_manifest.json` and `validation_manifest/step_manifest.json`.
- If manifest-backed lineage disagrees with the CLI declaration, fail before Azure registry/deployment mutation unless an explicit override is being tested.
- When an HPO winner config is exported into a repo-owned fixed-train config, preserve that repo-facing alias as `canonical_train_config` and prefer it over Azure ML's generic runtime filename such as `train_config.yaml`.

## Release attempts are audit records, not just happy-path receipts

- If a release has resolved a registered model version, write `release_record.json` even when the later deployment or smoke step fails.
- Prefer idempotent reuse for a validated matching model version; require an explicit force flag when intentionally creating a duplicate approved version.
- Treat deployment finalization as a first-class release outcome: delayed Azure success stays successful, while terminal failure or explicit finalization timeout still writes a release record before the command exits non-zero.

## Use explicit handoff summaries when the next lifecycle stage is still planned

- When a later stage such as monitoring is still planned, do not overclaim that it already exists just because earlier-stage evidence is available.
- Prefer a small derived handoff summary inside the upstream artifact, such as `release_record.json.monitoring_handoff`, so operators can interpret current readiness without reverse-engineering multiple raw fields.
- Keep the detailed evidence in the original sections and make the handoff summary explicitly bounded, for example `evidence_level = release_evidence_only`.

## Prefer repo-owned online scoring when deployment evidence must be explainable

- If deployment validation needs payload control, canary diagnostics, or later monitoring hooks, prefer a repo-owned `score.py` over the generated MLflow serving path.
- Keep release records bounded: they should summarize canary evidence and monitoring handoff state, not become a raw inference sink.
- When production inference evidence is needed, prefer repo-owned sampled capture with an explicit sink over Azure managed-online collector assumptions on this path.

## Prefer caller-side capture when deployment-owned capture is unavailable or untrusted

- If Azure ML managed-online logs classify scoring as `generated_runtime_still_in_control`, do not rely on endpoint-side `score.py` hooks or managed collector binding for production evidence.
- Even when the runtime is now proven as `repo_owned_scoring_proven`, deployment-owned capture can still be disabled or unavailable; caller-side capture remains the preferred bounded production-evidence path unless and until deployment-owned capture is externally proven.
- Route proof traffic through `run_inference_capture.py` or a future gateway that reuses `src/inference/client_capture.py`; direct endpoint calls bypass caller-side capture.
- A healthy proof requires the wrapper invoke to write retrievable JSONL records to Blob or local storage, then `run_monitor.py --capture-path <retrieved-dir>` must reach `capture_backed` with bounded schema and prediction-balance checks.

## Keep end-to-end lifecycle automation thin and artifact-first

- When release, caller capture, and monitoring already have separate repo-owned commands, compose them through a thin wrapper such as `run_release_monitor_smoke.py` instead of merging their business logic.
- Make the wrapper read child artifacts, not reconstruct state: `release_record.json` stays the release handoff, capture manifests stay the exact retrieval source, and `monitor_summary.json` stays the monitoring verdict.
- For reuse-safe cloud proofs, prefer an existing successful `release_record.json` plus a bounded probe set over unnecessary redeploys.

## Re-run monitoring from saved release truth instead of redeploying

- If the operator goal is post-release monitoring refresh rather than release validation, start from the saved `release_record.json` and reuse deployment coordinates from that artifact.
- Prefer a monitoring-first wrapper such as `run_monitor_handoff.py` over a fresh deploy or a release-proof wrapper when the deployment is already known-good.
- Treat repeated monitoring evidence as a new layer over saved release truth, not as a mutation of the original release outcome.

## Treat monitor-triggered retraining as a policy bridge, not hidden automation

- Let monitor outputs recommend `no_retraining_signal`, `retraining_candidate`, or `investigate_before_retraining`, but keep those states advisory.
- Any later retraining still needs a frozen dataset boundary plus `validate_data` before fixed training or HPO can start.
- Do not let monitor-stage policy outputs bypass promotion or release gates just because the evidence already looks actionable.

## Freeze explicit dataset identities before retraining validation

- When monitoring recommends retraining, require explicit `current_data` and `reference_data` identifiers before opening the next handoff.
- Preserve those identifiers in a frozen candidate manifest instead of pretending bounded capture logs are the retraining dataset.
- Reuse the existing validator after the freeze step; do not create a second validation path for monitor-triggered retraining.

## Reuse smoke deployments under Azure quota pressure

- Before creating another Azure ML managed online deployment in a quota-limited workspace, list existing deployments for the endpoint.
- If the goal is a smoke update of the same endpoint path, set the deployment-name override to the serving smoke deployment, such as `AML_ONLINE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=churn-smoke-silver`.
- Treat quota failures after model resolution as useful audit evidence only when the release writes a failed `release_record.json`.
