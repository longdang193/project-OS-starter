# Roadmap Closeout Readiness Prompt

## Use When

roadmap closure readiness is being decided

## Prerequisites

### Required

- registered workstream states and closure evidence available
- workstream closure reviewed via [workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md](./workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md) for all registered workstreams

### Optional

- output from [workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md](./workstream-closeout-readiness-prompt.md)

## Next Prompts

- terminal prompt (no further prompt required once closure-ready decision is returned)

## Not For

spec/plan authoring or implementation task selection

## Verification Before Completion Trigger

Required when proposing roadmap closure or claiming completion/pass status:

- run `verification-before-completion` checks before final close recommendation

Use this when deciding whether a roadmap can be marked `completed`.

Assess roadmap closeout readiness.

Related skills:
- verification-before-completion (use before any roadmap close/pass/fix claim)

Related workflows:
- roadmap-to-closeout-workflow.md (primary roadmap closure lifecycle)
- drift-detection-and-reconciliation-workflow.md (if closure invariants or evidence are inconsistent)

Context:
- roadmap path:
- registered workstreams:
- current roadmap/workstream statuses:
- roadmap phase structure (`Phase 1/2/3`) with per-phase Goal and Key Deliverables:
- known blockers:

Please:
1. Validate roadmap closure invariant:
   - roadmap `completed` is allowed only when all registered workstreams are terminal (`completed | dropped`).
   - for any workstream closing as `completed`, downstream coverage is present:
     - complete spec set map
     - spec-authoring map
     - implementation execution map
     - linked detailed specs
     - linked implementation plans
   - completed threads under completed workstreams have checkpoint evidence.
2. Validate roadmap structure readiness:
   - each phase (`Phase 1/2/3`) has its own non-empty Goal and Key Deliverables.
   - phase deliverables are not mixed across phases.
3. Verify roadmap content readiness:
   - roadmap-level Goal/Key Deliverables remain accurate for current lifecycle state.
   - evaluate deliverable-by-deliverable satisfaction and mark each as satisfied | unsatisfied.
4. List non-terminal workstreams (if any) and why they remain open.
5. Classify each blocker:
   - execution gap | evidence gap | status-hygiene gap | scope-decision gap
6. Recommend immediate next actions (top 3) to reach closeable state.
7. For the immediate next step, select one action only from existing artifacts:
   - roadmap/workstream/thread scope
   - approved specs
   - execution-map ordering/dependencies
   - current implementation plan tasks
   - open blockers and downstream impact
8. Return final recommendation:
   - close now | continue execution | re-scope
```

Expected output:
- roadmap closeout verdict, concrete next actions, and one selected next action constrained by existing planning artifacts
