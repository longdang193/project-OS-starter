# Master Workstream Roadmap Build Prompt

## Use When

intent is clear and a master roadmap structure must be authored or revised

## Prerequisites

### Required

- intent context is available

### Optional

- existing workstream registry

## Next Prompts

- registered-workstream-set-build-prompt.md
- downstream-reconciliation-after-roadmap-format-change.md

## Not For

thread-level execution or implementation planning
Use this when intent exists but the major delivery threads needed to reach the
end goal have not yet been mapped clearly enough.

```text
Build or refine the master workstream roadmap from the current intent docs.

Context:
- intent docs:
- end goal:
- important outcomes:
- constraints and non-goals:
- known operating_system concerns:

Please:
1. identify the major delivery threads needed to reach the end goal
2. distinguish product workstreams from `operating_system`
3. call out missing or vague top-level threads
4. draft or refine the master workstream roadmap
5. recommend the next artifact after the roadmap
```

Expected output:
- a proposed or updated master workstream roadmap
- identified major delivery threads
- next recommended artifact, usually the registered workstream set
