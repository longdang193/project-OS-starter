# Prompt Templates

Use these prompts when you want to guide an agent through the repo process in
a consistent way.

Lifecycle order:

1. `intent-prompt.md`
2. `master-workstream-roadmap-build-prompt.md`
3. `registered-workstream-set-build-prompt.md`
4. `bounded-change-thread-build-prompt.md`
5. `roadmap-to-workstream-prompt.md`
6. `workstream-to-spec-prompt.md`
7. `thread-set-to-spec-set-prompt.md`
8. `spec-set-to-spec-authoring-map-prompt.md`
9. `spec-prompt.md`
10. `spec-set-execution-map-prompt.md`
11. `plan-prompt.md`
12. `execute-prompt.md`
13. `validate-or-drift-prompt.md`
14. `managed-metadata-update-prompt.md`
15. `mode-migration-prompt.md`
16. `workstream-alignment-review-prompt.md`
17. `roadmap-gap-prompt.md`
18. `roadmap-vs-execution-divergence-prompt.md`
19. `provider-history-sync-prompt.md`
20. `gitnexus-refresh-prompt.md`
21. `parallel-bounded-change-planning-prompt.md`

Use the smallest prompt that matches the step you actually want.

Construction prompts:

- use a master-workstream-roadmap build prompt when intent exists and you need
  the major delivery threads
- use a registered-workstream-set build prompt when the roadmap exists and you
  need the concrete workstream set
- use a bounded-change-thread build prompt when a workstream exists and you
  need execution-capable slices or thread-file-ready outputs

Routing prompts:

- use an intent prompt when the project purpose or direction is still fuzzy
- use a roadmap-to-workstream prompt when you are translating intent or a
  roadmap thread into the right delivery branch
- use a workstream-to-spec prompt when a thread is already chosen and you want
  the next bounded design slice
- use a thread-set-to-spec-set prompt when you already have a thread set and
  want the complete spec inventory before detailed-spec authoring
- use a spec-set-to-spec-authoring-map prompt when the complete spec set exists
  and you need to sequence detailed-spec authoring
- use a spec-set-execution-map prompt when the approved detailed specs exist
  and you need a distinct implementation execution map for ordering, waves, and
  parallelism

Execution prompts:

- use a spec prompt when one chosen detailed spec needs to be written down
- use a plan prompt when the spec is approved and you want execution steps
- use an execution prompt when a plan already exists

Review and upkeep prompts:

- use a validation/drift prompt when you want to find gaps or missing surfaces
- use a managed-metadata update prompt when the repo is already in
  `managed_architecture_metadata` and you want to update or repair managed
  metadata surfaces in place
- use a mode-migration prompt when you want to assess or plan
  `starter_method_only -> managed_architecture_metadata`
- use a workstream-alignment review prompt when you want to sanity-check
  whether a proposed change actually belongs to the named workstream
- use a roadmap-gap prompt when you think the master roadmap may be missing a
  durable thread
- use a roadmap-vs-execution divergence prompt when you want to compare
  upstream roadmap/workstream intent against specs, plans, and execution so far
- use a provider-history sync prompt when Codex chats disappear after switching
  model providers and history metadata needs to be synced with
  `codex-provider-sync`
- use a GitNexus refresh prompt when GitNexus is stale, failing, or clearly out
  of sync with the current repo
- use a parallel bounded-change planning prompt when you already have bounded
  change candidates and want to know what can run in parallel safely

These are guidance files, not required repo artifacts.

The practical ladder is:

`intent -> master roadmap -> registered workstream set -> bounded change thread files -> complete spec set -> spec-authoring map -> detailed specs -> implementation execution map -> implementation plan -> execution`

with `operating_system` remaining a parallel branch when the work is really
about repo method rather than product delivery.

When the work is product-direction work, name the roadmap thread it follows.
When it is true operating-system work, say why it should remain
`parent_workstream: none`.

When naming a real workstream, use a valid ID from `docs/intent/workstreams/`.
