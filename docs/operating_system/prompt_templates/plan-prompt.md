# Plan Prompt

## Use When

approved work item context exists and an execution-ready implementation/patch plan is needed

## Prerequisites

### Required

- approved spec or execution-map context

### Optional

- execution map wave/lane

## Next Prompts

- execute-prompt.md

## Not For

spec discovery or closeout verdicts
Use this when the work item context is already approved and you want an execution-ready
plan, including patching work.

If the workstream is still unclear, use `roadmap-to-workstream-prompt.md`
before this prompt.
If multiple approved detailed specs still need sequencing or parallel-lane
decisions, use `spec-set-execution-map-prompt.md` first.

```text
Turn this approved work item context (or approved spec/patch context) into an execution-ready plan (implementation or patch).

Spec:
- path:
- bounded change thread this plan follows (use a valid thread id from `docs/intent/workstreams/threads/`, or `none`):
- if `none`, why this is operating_system work:
- implementation execution map path, if this plan is part of a multi-spec execution wave:

Please:
1. review the spec and classify the bounded change
2. make thread/spec lineage explicit in the plan metadata (`parent_thread`, `parent_spec`); use workstream-level `none` only when this is true operating_system work
3. write a concrete execution plan in docs/superpowers/plans/
4. name files to create or modify
5. include verification steps
6. keep the plan small, explicit, and execution-ready
7. if an implementation execution map exists, explain how this plan fits its wave or lane
```

Expected output:
- a plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`
