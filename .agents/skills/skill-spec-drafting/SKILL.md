# Spec Drafting

## Role

Draft and refine detailed specification artifacts only.

## Canonical References

<MUST-READ>
- `docs/operating_system/templates/detailed-specification-template.md`
- `docs/operating_system/templates/spec-authoring-map-template.md` when spec sequencing context exists
- `docs/operating_system/templates/task-start-routing-guide.md`
- `docs/operating_system/planning/planning-dispatch.md`
- `docs/operating_system/lifecycle/doc-system-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/operating_system/lifecycle/feature-lifecycle.md`
- `docs/operating_system/governance/repo-governance.md`

If this file conflicts with canonical templates/governance, follow canonical docs.
</MUST-READ>

## Mandatory Read

<MUST-READ>
Before drafting a spec, read:

- canonical references above, especially:
  - `docs/operating_system/planning/planning-dispatch.md`
  - `docs/operating_system/lifecycle/doc-system-lifecycle.md`
  - `docs/operating_system/templates/task-start-routing-guide.md`
  - `docs/operating_system/templates/detailed-specification-template.md`
</MUST-READ>

## Lifecycle Compliance

- Start from owning source layer before drafting downstream spec artifacts.
- Preserve triage classification (`intent | operating_system | workstream | change`) in spec metadata.
- Keep source-of-truth and generated-surface boundaries explicit.
- Keep design decisions, invariants, and validation proof in their canonical sections.
- Keep non-goals explicit so implementation plans stay bounded.

## Design Standard: Structural Symmetry

Ensure the specification enforces structural symmetry and invariance. The spec should consolidate equivalent logic into shared abstractions and explicitly reject unnecessary special cases. Preserve divergent logic only when mathematically, logically, or operationally required.

## Preconditions

- triage exists (`skill-planning-dispatch`)
- scope is bounded enough for a single detailed spec artifact
- unresolved design decisions are identified

## Pre-Write Contract Check

Before writing any file, confirm all:

- canonical output path required by `required_outputs`:
  - `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<topic>-spec.md`
- spec must satisfy required sections from `docs/operating_system/templates/detailed-specification-template.md`
- spec must include explicit:
  - acceptance criteria (testable)
  - non-goals (out-of-scope boundaries)
  - risks and mitigations
  - evidence fields in validation plan

## Spec Output

Default path:

- `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<topic>-spec.md`

Frontmatter should follow canonical planning schema for `artifact_type: spec`:

```yaml
---
layer: intent | operating_system | workstream | change
artifact_type: spec
status: proposed | active | completed | superseded
template_id: detailed-specification            # optional but recommended
name: <short-spec-name>                        # recommended canonical identity field
parent_workstream: <workstream-name> | none    # optional
targets:
  - <path>
related_features:
  - <feature_id>
related_stages:
  - <stage_id>
---
```

## Required Sections

Minimum required body sections:

1. Goal
2. Key Deliverables
3. Task/Wave Breakdown
4. Design Decisions
5. Invariants
6. Validation Plan
7. Completion Criteria

Add bounded sections for spec quality:

- Acceptance Criteria
- Non-Goals
- Risks and Mitigations

## Validation Plan Evidence Shape

For each proof target, record:

- proof target: <claim>
  - method: <test, inspection, run, comparison>
  - evidence: <expected proof artifact/output/path>

## Handoff Rules

- If design unresolved across multiple threads/specs, route to `skill-brainstorming`.
- After spec approval and design closure, hand off to `skill-writing-plans`.
- Do not produce implementation plan in this skill.
- Do not write code in this skill.

## Guardrails

- Keep this skill spec-only.
- Keep acceptance criteria observable and testable.
- Keep non-goals explicit; avoid scope creep.
- Avoid duplicating lifecycle policy text already owned by canonical docs.
