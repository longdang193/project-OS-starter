# Writing Plans

## Role

Create executable implementation plans from approved design context.

## Canonical References

- `docs/operating_system/templates/implementation-plan-template.md`
- `docs/operating_system/templates/task-start-routing-guide.md`
- `docs/operating_system/prompt_templates/implementation-next-action-gate-prompt.md`
- `docs/operating_system/repo-governance.md`

If this file conflicts with canonical templates/governance, follow canonical docs.

## Mandatory Read

Before drafting a plan, read:

- `docs/operating_system/templates/task-start-routing-guide.md`
- `docs/operating_system/templates/implementation-plan-template.md`

## Preconditions

- triage exists (`planning-dispatch`)
- design context exists (approved detailed spec or approved execution-map context)
- scope is bounded enough for implementation

## Plan Output

Default path:
- `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<topic>-plan.md`

Use the canonical implementation plan template and fill exact paths, tests, and commands.

## Minimal Workflow

1. confirm preconditions
2. map files/tests/docs affected
3. write small testable tasks
4. include validation commands and rollback notes where needed
5. hand off to `executing-plans` (or `subagent-driven-development`)

## Guardrails

- No implementation code in this skill.
- Do not duplicate lifecycle/routing policy text here.
- Keep guidance concise; canonical template carries required structure.
- Plan tasks so later execution can pick next actions via the next-action gate prompt.
- Do not author plan steps that require inventing unrelated execution actions.
